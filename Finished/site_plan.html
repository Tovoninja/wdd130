      <h2>My Plan</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Help people with there Youtube and to show people how to start with no experice</p>  <!-- change this -->

      

      <h3>What is the Tovoninja site?</h3> <p>The Tova Ninja site is designed to assist individuals in starting their own YouTube channels. It provides simple, step-by-step guidance and offers practical tips to improve the overall YouTube experience. The site aims to demystify the process of creating and growing a YouTube channel, making it accessible to everyone, regardless of their technical knowledge or experience. By sharing my personal journey and insights, I hope to inspire others to take the plunge and start their own channels.</p>

      <h3>Why will people come to your site?</h3> <p>One reason that people would come to this site is because they have actually watched my YouTube channel in the past. It sounds corny, maybe even a bit silly, but many individuals feel that starting a YouTube channel is way beyond their reach. I started YouTube because I watched a creator who was very minimalistic. He wasn't necessarily good at it either, but he made useful tutorials, and I found myself watching him a lot. This inspired me to start my own channel, and I want to pass on that inspiration to others. The site would show the simple steps in terms of starting a YouTube channel and what simple things somebody can do to improve their experience. By breaking down the process into manageable steps, I hope to empower people to take the first step and start their own channels.</p>
      
      <h3>What questions will your visitors expect your site to answer for them?</h3> <p>Visitors to the Tova Ninja site will have a lot of questions, and I aim to answer them comprehensively. Some of the questions that would be answered on the website include how to start a YouTube channel, what equipment is needed, and how to create engaging content. I'll have various videos that I felt were inspirational to my channel and explain how I did them. I'll also explain what I did wrong in those videos, showing people that everyone starts somewhere, and even if it's bad at first, it will get better with practice and time. This honest and transparent approach will help build trust with my audience and show them that they too can succeed.</p>
      
      <h3>What types of activities will visitors want to complete on your site?</h3> <p>I'd make my site interesting by allowing button clicking and interactive text. Visitors will want to complete activities such as watching tutorial videos, reading step-by-step guides, and interacting with tips and tricks to enhance their YouTube experience. They would also be able to see the genuine improvement over time, which can be a great motivator. I think that sometimes we look back at our past with a little bit of repulsion, but I would say looking at where we came from can help us understand where we are. By reflecting on our journey, we can appreciate the progress we've made and stay motivated to keep improving. The site would also offer resources for troubleshooting common issues, tips for optimizing videos for search, and strategies for growing a subscriber base.</p>
      
      <h3>What information is necessary to complete any actions your site offers?</h3> <p>For my website, I want it to be completely anonymous. Perhaps if I actually end up seeing it as incredibly useful, I could add a text box so that way people can provide feedback, explain what maybe works for them if they try going down this journey, or maybe advice that they have for the site. Other necessary information would include detailed tutorials, equipment recommendations, and best practices for creating and promoting videos. Having a section dedicated to analytics and statistics would also be incredibly useful, as it would help users measure their success and track their progress over time. This data can provide valuable insights into what works and what doesn't, allowing users to refine their strategies and improve their results. Additionally, providing case studies or success stories from other creators can offer inspiration and practical advice that users can apply to their own channels.</p>
      
      <h3>Why will your visitors come to your site instead of another to get this information or complete the actions?</h3> <p>You know, it's kind of interesting. I will say it is important to always look towards the elderly to receive advice. I especially sustain that people such as prophets and apostles of the Church of Jesus Christ are excellent sources for receiving direction, but I will acknowledge the fact that somebody who is 30 cannot always necessarily give the same advice to somebody who is 15. Not necessarily because their advice wouldn't be good, but sometimes people need advice from somebody who's experienced in a field. 30-year-olds are no longer experienced at being 15-year-olds, so much as professional YouTubers are not experienced at being a startup YouTuber. My site offers a unique perspective because I am sharing my journey as a relatively new YouTuber. This makes my advice more relatable and practical for those who are just starting out. Additionally, the interactive and community-focused nature of the site sets it apart from others. By fostering a sense of community and support, I hope to create a space where aspiring YouTubers can learn, grow, and succeed together.</p>
